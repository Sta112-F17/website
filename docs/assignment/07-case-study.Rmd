Even though you're working in teams on your project, you will be working individually on this case
study. But you can definitely collaborate with your teammates.

Task 1. Create a simple Shiny app that uses your project data.  
Task 2. Embed this Shiny app in an R Markdown document.

You do not have to include this in your project, but you can if you want.
