```

```{r message=FALSE}
pp <- read_csv("data/paris_paintings.csv", na = c("n/a", "", "NA"))
```

```{r}
library(forcats)
```

## Data fixes 

Collapse levels of `Shape` and `mat`erial variables.

.small[
```{r}
pp <- pp %>%
  mutate(
    Shape = fct_collapse(Shape, oval = c("oval", "ovale"),
                                round = c("round", "ronde"),
                                squ_rect = "squ_rect",
                                other = c("octogon", "octagon", "miniature")),
    mat = fct_collapse(mat, metal = c("a", "br", "c"),
                            canvas = c("co", "t", "ta"),
                            paper = c("p", "ca"),
                            wood = "b",
                            other = c("e", "g", "h", "mi", "o", "pa", "v", "al", "ar", "m"))
  )
```

## Review fixes

.small[
```{r}
pp %>%
  count(Shape)

pp %>%
  count(mat)
```
]

## Review: Main effects, numerical predictors

```{r}
(m_main_n <- lm(log(price) ~ Width_in + Height_in, data = pp))
```

---

## Visualizing the model

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(rgl)
library(knitr)
```

```{r webgl=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
x = pp$Width_in
y = pp$Height_in
z = log(pp$price)
plot3d(x, y, z, col = "black", xlab = "Width_in", ylab = "Height_in", zlab = "log(price)")
rglwidget()
```

---

## Visualizing the model, with the prediction surface

```{r webgl=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
x = pp$Width_in
y = pp$Height_in
z = log(pp$price)

n = 20
x = seq(min(x, na.rm = TRUE), max(x, na.rm = TRUE), length = n)
y = seq(min(y, na.rm = TRUE), max(y, na.rm = TRUE), length = n)

l = lm(log(price) ~ Width_in + Height_in, data = pp)

f = function(x,y)
{ 
  predict(l, data.frame(Width_in = x, Height_in = y))
}
z = outer(x,y,f)

surface3d(x, y, z, back = 'lines', front = 'lines', col = 'blue', lwd = 1.5, alpha = 0.4)
rglwidget()
```

## Review: Main effects, numerical and categorical predictors

.small[
```{r}
pp_Surf_lt_5000 <- pp %>%
  filter(Surface < 5000)
m_main <- lm(log(price) ~ Surface + factor(artistliving), data = pp_Surf_lt_5000)
round(exp(m_main$coefficients), 4)
```
]

```{r include=FALSE}
surf_coef <- tidy(m_main) %>% filter(term == "Surface") %>% pull(estimate) %>% exp() %>% round(4)
artistliving_coef <- tidy(m_main) %>% filter(term == "factor(artistliving)1") %>% pull(estimate) %>% exp() %>% round(2)
intercept <- tidy(m_main) %>% filter(term == "(Intercept)") %>% pull(estimate) %>% exp() %>% round(2)
```

- All else held constant, for each additional square inch in painting's surface area, the price of the painting is predicted, on average, to be higher by a factor of `r surf_coef`.

- All else held constant, paintings by a living artist are predicted, on average, to be higher by a factor of `r artistliving_coef` compared to paintings by an artist who is no longer alive.

- Paintings that are by an artist who is not alive and that have a surface area of 0 square inches are predicted, on average, to be `r intercept` livres.

## What went wrong?

<div class="question">
Why is our linear regression model different from what we got from `geom_smooth(method = "lm")`?
</div>

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(pp_Surf_lt_5000, aes(x = Surface, y = log(price), color = factor(artistliving))) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(pp_Surf_lt_5000, aes(x = Surface, y = log(price), color = factor(artistliving))) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 4.8800835, slope = 0.0002653, color = "#F8766D", alpha = 0.75, size = 1.5) + 
  geom_abline(intercept = (4.8800835+0.1372103), slope = 0.0002653, color = "#00BFC4", alpha = 0.75, size = 1.5)
```


---

## What went wrong? (cont.)

- The way we specified our model only lets `artistliving` affect the intercept.

- Model implicitly assumes that paintings with living and deceased artists have the *same slope* and only allows for *different intercepts*.  

- What seems more appropriate in this case? 
    
    * Same slope and same intercept for both colors
    
    * Same slope and different intercept for both colors
    
    * Different slope and different intercept for both colors?

---

## Interacting explanatory variables

- Including an interaction effect in the model allows for different slopes, i.e. 
nonparallel lines.

- This implies that the regression coefficient for an explanatory variable would 
change as another explanatory variable changes.

- This can be accomplished by adding an interaction variable: the product of two 
explanatory variables.

## Price vs. surface and artist living interacting

.small[
```{r fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(data = pp_Surf_lt_5000,
       mapping = aes(y = log(price), x = Surface, color = factor(artistliving))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", fullrange = TRUE)
```
]

---

## Modeling with interaction effects

.small[
```{r}
(m_int <- lm(log(price) ~ Surface * factor(artistliving), data = pp_Surf_lt_5000))
```
]

$$ \widehat{log(price)} = 4.91 + 0.00021~surface - 0.126~artistliving + 0.00048~surface \times artistliving $$

---

## Interpretation of interaction effects

- Rate of change in price as the surface area of the painting increases does 
vary between paintings by living and non-living artists (different slopes), 

- Some paintings by living artists are more expensive than paintings by
non-living artists, and some are not (different intercept).

.small[
.pull-left[
- Non-living artist: 
$\widehat{log(price)} = 4.91 + 0.00021~surface$
$- 0.126 \times 0 + 0.00048~surface \times 0$
$= 4.91 + 0.00021~surface$

- Living artist: 
$\widehat{log(price)} = 4.91 + 0.00021~surface$
$- 0.126 \times 1 + 0.00048~surface \times 1$
$= 4.91 + 0.00021~surface$
$- 0.126 + 0.00048~surface$
$= 4.784 + 0.00069~surface$
]
.pull-right[
```{r fig.height=4, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = pp_Surf_lt_5000,
       aes(y = log(price), x = Surface, color = factor(artistliving))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", fullrange = TRUE)
```

## Third order interactions

- Can you? Yes

- Should you? Probably not if you want to interpret these interactions in context
of the data.

# Quality of fit in MLR

## $R^2$

- $R^2$ is the percentage of variability in the response variable explained by the 
regression model.

```{r}
glance(m_main)$r.squared
glance(m_int)$r.squared
```

--

- Clearly the model with interactions has a higher $R^2$.

--

- However using $R^2$ for model selection in models with multiple explanatory 
variables is not a good idea as $R^2$ increases when **any** variable is added to the 
model.

---

## $R^2$ - first principles

$$ R^2 =  \frac{ SS\_{Reg} }{ SS\_{Total} } = 1 - \left( \frac{ SS\_{Error} }{ SS\_{Total} } \right) $$

<div class="question">
Calculate $R^2$ based on the output below.
</div>

```{r}
anova(m_main)
```

---

## Adjusted $R^2$

$$ R^2\_{adj} = 1 - \left( \frac{ SS\_{Error} }{ SS\_{Total} } \times \frac{n - 1}{n - k - 1} \right), $$

where $n$ is the number of cases and $k$ is the number of predictors in the model

--

- Adjusted $R^2$ doesn't increase if the new variable does not provide any new 
informaton or is completely unrelated.

--

- This makes adjusted $R^2$ a preferable metric for model selection in multiple
regression models.

---

## In pursuit of Occam's Razor

- Occam's Razor states that among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, 
the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.

- Model selection follows this principle.

- We only want to add another variable to the model if the addition of that
variable brings something valuable in terms of predictive power to the model.

- In other words, we prefer the simplest best model, i.e. **parsimonious** model.

---

## Comparing models

It appears that adding the interaction actually increased adjusted $R^2$, so we 
should indeed use the model with the interactions.

```{r}
glance(m_main)$adj.r.squared
glance(m_int)$adj.r.squared
```

# Model selection

---

## Backwards elimination

- Start with **full** model (including all candidate explanatory variables and all
candidate interactions)

- Remove one variable at a time, and select the model with the highest adjusted $R^2$

- Continue until adjusted $R^2$ does not increase

---

## Forward selection

- Start with **empty** model

- Add one variable (or interaction effect) at a time, and select the model with the 
highest adjusted $R^2$

- Continue until adjusted $R^2$ does not increase

---

## Model selection and interaction effects

If an interaction is included in the model, the main effects of both of
those variables must also be in the model

---

## Other model selection criteria

- Adjusted $R^2$ is one model selection criterion

- There are others out there (many many others!), we'll discuss some later in the 
course, and some you might see in another courses
